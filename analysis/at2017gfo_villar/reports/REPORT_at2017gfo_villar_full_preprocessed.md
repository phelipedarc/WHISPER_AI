# AT2017GFO — Villar+2017-style two-component kilonova with WHISPER (preprocessed UVOIR)

Real-data application: the redback `two_component_kilonova` model with **κ_blue = 0.5 cm²/g fixed**, redshift fixed (z = 0.00984), **κ_red and both temperature floors free**, fit to the AT2017GFO **preprocessed UV → optical → NIR photometry** (10 bands, Swift-UVOT `uvw1` dropped, SNR > 5, one observation per band per 0.01 d epoch, 0–30 d) in **apparent-magnitude space** (Villar+17; σ ≈ fractional-flux scatter [mag]). The likelihood-based and neural methods also fit the **Villar+17 extra-scatter term σ** (added in quadrature to the reported errors):

$$\ln\mathcal{L} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\sum_i\left[\frac{(O_i-M_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2+\sigma^2} + \ln\big(2\pi(\sigma_i^2+\sigma^2)\big)\right]$$

*(the correctly normalized form of Villar et al. 2017, Eq. 4, as implemented in MOSFiT). The distance-based ABC family fits the 7 physical parameters only: a χ² rejection distance is monotonically penalised by extra simulation noise, so a noise-level parameter is not identifiable by distance-based ABC — verified on synthetic data.*

*Reference — **Villar et al. 2017 (ApJL 851 L21), Table 2, 2-component fit** (κ_blue = 0.5 fixed, matching this setup): M_ej^blue = 0.023 M☉, v^blue = 0.256 c, T^blue = 3983 K, M_ej^red = 0.050 M☉, v^red = 0.149 c, κ_red = 3.65 cm²/g, T^red = 1151 K, σ = 0.256 mag (WAIC = −1030). Villar+17 fit a much larger UV–optical–NIR dataset with a radiative-transfer-calibrated model, so the absolute values are a literature anchor, not ground truth. The medians ÷ Villar+17 are compared in the summary figure below.*

## Goodness-of-fit & cost

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MCMC | 117.9 | 1.05 | 0.92 | 5146 | 5146 | 221 |
| ABC | 154.3 | 154.34 | 0.81 | 714 | 714 | 50048 |
| ABC-SMC | 171.5 | 171.45 | 0.71 | 857 | 857 | 55747 |

*χ²/dof against the reported errors is ≫1 for every method — high-SNR kilonova photometry always carries model systematics beyond the measurement errors; that is exactly what σ absorbs: with the fitted scatter the χ²/dof (σᵢ ⊕ σ) is ≈1 and the predictive coverage is nominal. AIC values are comparable only among methods fitting the same parameter set (the ABC family omits σ).*

## Interpretation

- **The scatter term works.** MCMC recovers an extra scatter **σ ≈ 0.32 mag**, in the ballpark of **Villar+2017's σ = 0.256 mag** (the neural σ posteriors run broader — a single light curve weakly constrains a noise level). Folding it in quadrature turns the χ²/dof (vs reported errors) into ≈1 with nominal 95% predictive coverage — the excess is model systematics (a semi-analytic two-component kilonova can't capture every spectral feature), exactly what Villar+17 introduced σ to absorb.
- **Blue component.** With κ_blue fixed at 0.5 the blue component is well-specified in regime; MCMC gives v_ej^blue ≈ 0.30 c — pushed to the fast edge of the physical prior (the optical decline wants fast blue ejecta; the degeneracy only fully breaks with NIR).
- **Red component — now constrained.** κ_red is *free* and the lanthanide-rich red ejecta radiate mostly in the NIR; with the full UV–optical–NIR data the red parameters pull off the prior edges toward physical values (MCMC κ_red ≈ 1.6 cm²/g vs Villar+2017's 3.65). This is the payoff of adding the NIR bands the optical-only fit lacked.
- **Early-time peak timing.** In **i-band**, MCMC's best-fit curve peaks at t≈1.16 d — **+0.64 d** from the brightest *observed* point (t≈0.52 d) — even though the aggregate χ²/dof and coverage look good (visible in the zoomed early-time PPC below, not the aggregate metrics: a handful of near-peak points are outweighed by the many post-peak points in the χ² sum, and the fitted scatter σ absorbs the residual). Present in **both magnitude and flux space** at similar magnitude, so it is not a units/weighting artifact — most plausibly the semi-analytic two-component model's single-diffusion-timescale-per-component approximation not capturing the very early (<1 d) rise/peak shape as precisely as a full radiative-transfer calculation.
- **MCMC vs simulation-based inference.** MCMC finds the sharp maximum-likelihood mode (χ²/dof = 118 vs reported errors, lowest AIC); the amortized/rejection samplers report a broader posterior bulk. They agree on the well-constrained quantities (blue ejecta, σ) and diverge where the data are least informative — the honest signature of a real-data fit.
- **Amortized inference.** Once trained, NPE conditions a *new* AT2017GFO-like light curve in ~10–80 ms (the per-object column) versus a full refit for MCMC — the payoff of neural SBI when many objects share one model.

## Figures

### Posterior histograms

Per-parameter marginal posteriors (rows) for every method (columns), each annotated with its median ± 68% CI; each variable shares one x-range across methods for direct comparison. σ is *not fitted* by the distance-based ABC family.

### Corner plot

Joint posteriors of all fitted parameters (ejecta masses shown as log₁₀), every method overlaid. The neural and ABC methods overlap in a broad central region while MCMC (dark blue) sits apart in its sharp, prior-edge MAP — the mode tension made visual, including the parameter correlations (e.g. M_ej^red–v_ej^red, κ_red–T_floor^red).

### Posterior-predictive light curves

Each method's 95% posterior-predictive model band in g/r/i (coloured) over the AT2017GFO photometry, with the per-panel χ²/dof (vs reported errors and vs errors ⊕ σ) and 95% coverage. MCMC gives the tightest, best-tracking band; the neural methods carry wider bands reflecting the marginal σ uncertainty.
